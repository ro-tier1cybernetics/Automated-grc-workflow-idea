# Automated grc workflow idea
I know there are many different automation tools available for grc auditors/professionals and I already use a few myself. With that in mind, I would still like to spend time creating my own. Something thatâ€™s personally tailored for myself and the information I need pertaining to assuring compliance and ease of use with mapping controls/frameworks.
